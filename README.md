# Autonomous-UAV-Landing

This repo is for testing and implementing different controllers and trajectory generation methods for Landing on a moving platform.

```bash
cd catkin_ws/src

#for SSH
git clone git@github.com:devrajPriyadarshi/Autonomous-UAV-Landing.git

#for HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/devrajPriyadarshi/Autonomous-UAV-Landing.git
```

## Addition files
- This repo contains landing_static.world and landing_moving.world in rotors_gazebo/worlds folder.
- A firefly drone with a downwards camera (to be added soon).
To launch the autonomous landing use :
```bash
roslaunch rotors_gazebo autonomous_landing.launch #this by default loads the static world

#OR

roslaunch rotors_gazebo autonomous_landing.launch moving_base:=true #for moving platform
```

## Papers for Reading
A general manual for working with RotorS Simulator can be found in : [RotorS â€“ A Modular Gazebo MAV Simulator Framework](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309291237), you can read specific parts of its right now for commanding the drone using rostopics, and how to make your own controller. The latter can be done by commenting out the lee controller node of ypur launch file,
```
<node name="lee_position_controller_node" pkg="rotors_control" type="lee_position_controller_node" output="screen">
  <rosparam command="load" file="$(find rotors_gazebo)/resource/lee_controller_$(arg mav_name).yaml" />
  <rosparam command="load" file="$(find rotors_gazebo)/resource/$(arg mav_name).yaml" />
  <remap from="odometry" to="odometry_sensor1/odometry" />
</node>
 ````
 and adding your own controller node created in rotors_control package.
